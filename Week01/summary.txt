Data is crucial in every domain since it helps with information storage, which saves time and effort. Statistics is a significant part of mathematics that is aimed to allow for comprehensive data interpretation. The author of this article, David Donoho, aims to display his data science insights based on the behaviors of people learning from data and tries to describe its future utilization in this work. He also tries to clarify why Data Science is based on statistics. Statisticians, he claims, believe that the data science initiative phenomena are more akin to what they have already explored. Also, the introduction of DSI-like initiatives by colleges makes it appear that statistics is not a key component of Data Science, but when we read the description of what exactly DSI is, how it works, and what statisticians have been doing for a long time, we realize that this is not the case. Many computer scientists have chosen data scientists to believe it is concerned with genuinely massive data that conventional statisticians cannot handle and that data science trainees have the expertise required for big data sets.
Nevertheless, the unpleasant fact that David is attempting to highlight here is that for a long time, such complicated computational jobs could be easily accomplished in a single collection of variables, and these were the result of or about 50 years of development. The success of a multinational IT corporation also fueled much interest in data science. Many statisticians have established the groundwork for expanding classical statistics, which is now comparable to the data science we use most over the last five decades. We could improve the precision and credibility of scientific knowledge through this investigation, but it would not develop instantly.
